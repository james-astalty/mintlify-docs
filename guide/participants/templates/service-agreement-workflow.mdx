## Creating a Budget and Generating a Service Agreement in Astalty

This Workflow guide will walk you through the steps of creating a budget, assigning it to an Astalty custom template, and sending the agreement for signature using Astalty's eSignature functionality. Follow the steps below to see how much time you can save by using this workflow.

This is ideally happening right after you complete a referral submission profile creation. Learn more about that via this link [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/referrals/referral-follow-up).

## First Step

1. Go to the profile of the participant for whom you want to create a budget.
2. On the left side menu under **Utilisation**, click on the **Budget** selection.

1. Create a Service
2. Generate a Service Agreement
3. Export as PDF

## Export as PDF for a Quote

This option is best if you are looking to generate a quote to send to new participants or to external providers for your services.

## Create a Service

This option will create a service using the budget data allowing you to bill this participant from Astalty using this budget. More on creating a service can be found through this link [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/ndis-plan/services). We have created a detailed walkthrough on the service creation process.

## Generate a Service Agreement Using Astalty Templates

1. Once the budget is complete, you can create a service agreement.
2. Click **Generate Service Agreement**.
3. Select a template. You can use an existing template within your organization or upload a Word document. Astalty recommends using the Astalty template with placeholders for dynamic information.
4. Select the budget you just created. You can also include past budgets in this section if needed.
5. Click **Generate** to create the service agreement draft.
