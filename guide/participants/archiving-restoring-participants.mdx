Participant's can not be permanently deleted in Astalty but they can be archived. There's a few important things to note when archiving a Participant;

1. Only those with the **Admin** role can archive Participants.
2. Archiving a Participant will not affect any Tasks and charges that have not yet been invoiced - they will be invoiced as usual.
3. Archiving a Participant does not delete any data.
4. Participants will no longer display in certain reports and won't display in the Participants table without adding a Status filter to show Archived Participants.

## Archiving a Participant

To Archive a Participant, navigate to the [**Participants**](https://app.astalty.com.au/participants) page and find the Participant you need to archive. Click on the Participant to be taken to their profile.

Once you're looking at the Participant's profile you can click the _Actions_ button and then click _Archive_.

## Finding Archived Participants

Archived Participants will not display in the Participants table by default.

To find archived Participants, you will need to add a Status filter. You can do this by clicking on the Filter icon and clicking _Status_

Once you've added the Status filter you need to select the _Archived _option - this will then show all archived Participants where you can search by NDIS number, name or email.

## Restoring Archived Participants

Once you have found the Participant you want to restore, click into their profile and click the _Actions_ button - you can then click _Restore_ to restore the Participant.
