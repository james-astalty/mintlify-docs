description: "The Participant's Financial page is where you can manage where invoices will be sent for the Participant.
Within the Invoice Details section there are 2 sections - one for self managed and one for plan managed invoices. You only need to complete the relevant section for that Participant. In some cases, a Participant may be both self managed and plan managed for different supports."

Within the Plan Managed invoice section, you can search for an existing Plan Manager - if one is not found, you will be prompted to create a new Plan Manager.

### Additional Plan Managed invoice emails

Sometimes you may want to send any invoices that are going to the Plan Manager to the Participant or someone else. You can utilise the Additional Plan Managed invoice emails field to do this.

In the example below, any invoice sent to the Plan Manger O'Hara Solutions for this Participant will also be sent to [john@example.com](mailto:john@example.com) and [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com).

You can then select the invoice types you'd like to show the Task name on. This allows you to have fine grained control and ensure that Task names are only being shown on certain invoices.
