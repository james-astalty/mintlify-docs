## Overview

You can record specific risks related to an individual participant directly within their profile in Astalty. This acts as your risk register and works alongside the Risks Report to help you track and manage potential issues. In this guide, we’ll walk through how to create a risk entry, including details such as the risk description, likelihood, consequences, potential impact, existing controls, and the adjusted likelihood after controls are in place. Once added, all risks are calculated using a risk matrix, and are summarised in an overview section in the Risks menu.

## Assessment

Once you have entered the risk details you will then perform the risk assessment this is broken down into the following sections

- Likelihood

- Control

### Likelihood

This outlines the likelihood of the risk occurring for the participant and is broken down to a selection of the following frequencies;

![Likelihood](/images/likelihood.png)

### Consequence

This section outlines the impact of the risk on the person outlined in the details section. The consequence of a risk does not change regardless of any entered controls.

![Consequence](/images/consequence.png)

### Control

This section allows you to add a control, by clicking 'Add Control' to outline what risk controls exist to lower the likelihood of the risk incident. Once you have added a control them you can select the likelihood of the risk occurring with the control in place.

Keep in mind, this likelihood rating is for all controls for this risk not a specific control.

![Control](/images/control.png)

You can add multiple control options to this risk entry (1), and you can also remove a control by clicking the 'X' to the right of the control (2).

## Risk Overview

Once you have completed the above information Astalty will input the information to the Risk matrices and will give you a risk score for the Inherent (pre control) and Residual (post control) risk.

## Risk Review

Once you have added risks to a participant profile, Astalty will give you an overall risk score for the Inherent (pre control) and Residual (post control) risks for this participant. This will display on the Risks menu on the participants profile.

## Risks Report

We also have a Participant Risks Report (click [**here**](https://app.astalty.com.au/reports/participants/risks)) that will display all of the risk you have entered for your participants and will display the risk score for the number of specific levels of risk for Inherent (pre control) and Residual (post control) risks for all participants.
