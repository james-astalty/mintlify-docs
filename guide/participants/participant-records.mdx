## Adding Records to Participant Profiles

From the main menu, select Participant and choose the desired individual's profile. Within a participants profile Scroll down to the Records section within the participant's profile.

Once in the record click on **Create Participant Record** and select the appropriate record type from the dropdown menu.

Fill in additional details such as:

- **Issue Date**
- **Expiry Date**
- **Reference Number** (if applicable)
- **Description** of the record (e.g., Service Agreement 2024)

Documents can be added by dragging and dropping files into the designated area. There is also an option to add existing documents to the record as well as send documents for signing.

**Tip:** Adding existing documents is particularly useful for users wishing to track expiry dates of previously uploaded documents.

Once all information is entered and documents are uploaded, click **Create Record**.

## Viewing Participant Records

In the record screen, you can view each Participant Record with details such as its status (current or expired), whether it has been sent for signing, the record name, and the expiry date on the far right-hand side.

**Handy Hint: **You can check the status of all documents across the organisation and or based on a staff member's caseload via the reports section.

## Sending Participant Records

You can send records from within the Record by selecting the 'Actions' button and then select the 'Email' option. You will then have to enter the email address for the recipient.

## Deleting Documents from Records

You can now delete documents from within Records! One caveat is that a record must have at least one document assigned before you can delete a document. You can do this from within the edit record screen.
