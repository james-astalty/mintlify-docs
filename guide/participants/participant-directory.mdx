## Participant Directory

Astalty has a powerful new feature called Participant Directory. This directory will now show both participant contacts and also the linked providers created in the implementation section of the participants profile. 

You can find this information my navigating to the participants profile and selecting the ‘Directory’ button (previously contacts). A screenshot below has been added to help with the navigation.
