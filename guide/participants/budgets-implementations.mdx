<Warning>
  **If you are not providing Support Coordination, you may not need this feature**

  Budgets and implementations are designed to give Coordinators tools to track where they have implemented supports for their Participants. If you are not providing this service, you may not need to use Budgets or Implementations.
</Warning>

## Managing Budgets

The first thing to do when tracking Implementations for a Participant is to add all of their NDIS budgets to Astalty. To do this, navigate to the NDIS plan you'd like to add implementations for and within the Implementations section, click _Add Budgets._

Once on the budgets page, you should add every budget as listed in the NDIS plan - this should essentially be a digital copy of the NDIS plan.

Once all of the budgets have been added click _Update_ and you will be taken back to the NDIS plan page. Here you can see all of the budgets and how much has been implemented. Once budgets have been created you can click the _Update Budgets_ button to edit them and adjust the budgets if need be.

## Managing Implementations

To manage Implementations with an NDIS plan, you must ensure all budgets have been created first. Then you can click _Manage_ within the Implementations section.

### Overview

Once you're in the Implementations page you will see a breakdown of each of your budgets as well as any existing Implementations.

## Creating an Implementation

To create your first implementation, click _Add Implementation_ within the budget group you'd like to add an Implementation for. Within this form you will only be able to select from the Budgets you have created within the plan.

When you have selected the budget and added a name click _Create_ and you will be taken to add more details about the implementation.
