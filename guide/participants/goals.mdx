## Overview

Astalty allows you to store and track Participant Goals as well as associate them with Tasks, Plans and Implementations.

## Creating Goals

To create a Goal for a Participant, navigate to their profile and click _Goals_ in the sidebar.

On this page, click _Add Goal_ and you will see the Participant Goal form.

<Info>
  **Handy Hint**

  Astalty goals are either achieved or not achieved meaning that if the goal was not met within the plan period then the goal would be marked as "Unattainable" within the goal list.

## Attaching Goals to Tasks

Once Goals have been created for Participants, you can attach Goals to Tasks by navigating to the Goals tab within a Task and clicking _Add Goal_

## **Attaching Goals to Implementations**

When updating an Implementation, you can attach Goals from the Plan the Implementation has been created within by editing the Implementation and select the relevant goals at the bottom of the page.

## Printing Goals

To print a PDF of the Goals, open the **Goals** page on the Participants profile, click **Actions** and select **Download as PDF**.

This will generate a document containing all of the Participant’s listed Goals, including the Goal, Status, Type, Description, Achievement Strategies, and Barriers, and will be formatted as shown below.

If you have uploaded your Business Logo, it will also appear on the PDF.

## **Visibility for Support Workers**

To make a goal visible in the Support Worker app, select Visible to Support Workers when creating or editing the goal. Visible goals will display for the support worker, including the description, strategies, and barriers.
