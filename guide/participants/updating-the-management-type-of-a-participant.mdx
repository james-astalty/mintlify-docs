## Updating The Management Type of A Participant

If you need to update the management type of a participant for any reason you can do that within their NDIS Plan Page. Once in the plan page select the service for the management type you would like to change.

Once you have clicked on the service, click 'Edit' in the top right corner to update the service details. Once in the Update Service screen you will notice a drop down menu under the 'Management Type' heading. Select the drop down box and you will see that you can select either, NDIA Managed, Plan Managed, or Self Managed from this list.
