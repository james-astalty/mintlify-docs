## Overview

In the Template on a participants profile you will be able to generate templates, custom or NDIA specific, with user information gathered on their profile. Astalty does this through the use of 'Placeholders'.

Within templates you can access the following types of templates;

- Custom Template Generation
- NDIA Templates
- Generated Documents

## Custom Template Generation

You can set up custom templates within [**Template Settings**](https://app.astalty.com.au/settings/templates) for more information on this process please see our Template Settings user guide [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/settings/template-settings).

For more information about Custom Template Generation [**click this link**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/templates/custom-templates) to read our user guide article about this process.

## Generated Documents

Within this page we have also added a section that you can use to view previously generated documents.

By clicking on a document you will be sent to the finalised document screen, or draft screen depending on the document status. From the document screen you can either Create a Record and send the document for signing through our eSignature functionality (more on that [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/getting-started/astalty-premium/budget-builder-to-esignature-request#:~:text=Sending%20for%20Signature,for%20e%2Dsignature.)), or download the file to get it signed manually or for record keeping.

## NDIA Templates

Astalty has taken the busy work away from you by supplying NDIA templates that can be prefilled with information from the participant profile. This has saved our users hours! For more information about this process you can view our user guide article [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/templates/ndis_templates)
