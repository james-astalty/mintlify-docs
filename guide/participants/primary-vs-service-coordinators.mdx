title: "Primary vs Service Coordinators"
---

## Overview

In Astalty, you can store both a Primary Coordinator for the participant's Profile and a Service Coordinator for each service you have setup. The Primary and Service Coordinator fields can be used within Astalty to determine user caseloads and provide a filterable option within some of the reports within Astalty.

## Primary or Service Coordinator?

### Primary Coordinator

Generally the Primary Coordinator should be the case manager or the team member who will be working with this Participant the most. They are generally the person that will be tasked with ensuring the profile and any supporting documentation is up to date.

### Service Coordinator

The Service Coordinator is the Team Member who is in charge of coordinating or delivering the Service that they're assigned to. This is helpful if you are delivering several services to the same Participant. For core supports, this may be a Team Leader or Case Manager. For Support Coordination services, this would typically be the Support Coordinator. This ensures there is a clear point of contact for each service, especially if the Participant is receiving multiple services at once.

## Add a Service Coordinator

To assign a Service Coordinator to an existing service, navigate to the _NDIS Plan_ page within the Participants Profile and select the _Service_ you wish to open.
