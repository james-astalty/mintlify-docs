In Astalty you can create 2 different types of Budgets;

- Internal Budgets
  - These should be used when you need to calculate the cost of a service you will be delivering to the Participant
- External Budgets
  - These should be used when you'd like to calculate the cost of supports that another Provider will be delivering

## Creating a Budget

To create a budget, navigate to the Participant you'd like to calculate the budget for and click on the Budgets page in the sub-menu.

Then, click on _Create Budget_

### Name

When creating a Budget, you'll need to enter a name for the budget - this should be short but descriptive.

### Budget Type

You can choose between an Internal Budget and an External Budget.

#### **Internal Budget**

Use an Internal Budget if you will be delivering the Service.

- You will be able to use Charge Items to create the Budget
- You will be able to create a Service from the Budget
- You will be able to export the budget as a PDF

#### **External Budget**

Use an External Budget if you'd like to calculate the cost for service another Provider will be delivering

- You will be able to use all items from the Price Guide to create the Budget
- You will **not** be able to create a Service from the Budget
- You will be able to export the budget as a PDF

### Budget Dates

If the Participant already has a Plan in Astalty, you can use those dates or you can enter any other dates.

## Budget Items

When using an Internal Budget, you will be able to add Budget Items using Charge Items. If you have created an External Budget, you will have access to the full NDIS Price Guide to create your budget.

## Generate Service Agreement

You can generate a service agreement via the budgets menu. To learn more about the custom template functionality click [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/templates/custom-templates). This budget will populate the Schedule of Supports placeholder for Service Agreement template types.

## Creating a Service

If you have created an Internal Budget, you will be able to create a Service from the Budget so you don't have to re-calculate the total amount. Simply click the _Actions_ button and click _Create Service._
