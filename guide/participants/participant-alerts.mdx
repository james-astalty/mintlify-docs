## Creating Alerts

Once the form opens, you can create the Alert. The fields and their purpose are outlined below.

### Title

This will be the main heading for the alert. An example might be **Melyna is currently in hospital.**

### Content

The content field allows you to provide some additional details about the alerts. It's good to keep this down to a sentence or two.

### Alert Type

There are currently 2 types of alerts;

- Info - this will appear as blue
- Warning - this will appear as amber

Aside from the colour, there is not functional difference between the type of alert.

## Alert Notifications

When creating an Alert, at the bottom of the form is the notifications section.

### Primary Coordinator

Tick this option if you would like to notify the Participant's Primary Coordinator.

### Notify Others

If you select the _Notify others _option, you will be given the chance to select other team members or user groups to notify when the alert is created.

## Removing an alert

Once an alert has been created, anyone with permission to update the Participant will be able to remove the alert. You can remove the alert by clicking the X button as outlined in the screenshot below.

<Note>
  **Creating an alert will create a matching Note**

  When an alert is added to a Participant's profile, Astalty will create a Note with the same content directly on the Participant's profile so that even when the Alert is deleted, there will still be a record that the alert existed.

## Updating an Alert

Once created, Participant Alerts can not be updated. You will need to remove the alert and create a new one.

## Alert Note Template

We also have a note template type for Alerts. To learn more about note templates click [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/settings/tasks-notes-settings/note-templates) for our user guide
