You can view all Documents for a Participant within their Documents page on their profile.

You can also view Documents assigned to Contacts, Organisations, and Plan Managers by heading to the [**Directory**](https://app.astalty.com.au/directory/plan-managers) and opening their profile. There's more information on viewing Documents in each of the following guides:

- [**Contacts**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/directory/contacts)
- [**Organisations**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/directory/organisations)
- [**Plan Managers**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/directory/plan-managers)

## Viewing Documents

In Astalty you can attach documents to;

- a Task
- a Note
- a Participant
- a Plan
- an Implementation
- a Record
- an Information Item
- a Plan Manager
- an Organisation
- a Contact

On the Participant's Documents page, Astalty will show all Documents for a Participant, regardless of the place where they were uploaded.

To view a Document head to the Participant's Documents page and click on the Document itself (1) or click the 3 dots to the right hand side (2) and click **View**. You also have the option to **Download**, or **Delete** the Document from here.

## Uploading Documents

To upload a Document directly to a Participant's profile, click on the **Upload Documents** button. This will open the Upload Documents form where you can click to browse files on your computer or drag and drop directly into the outlined area.

### Editing the Document Name before Uploading

Once you've selected your file, you can edit the name of the Document — this is what will display in Astalty.

### Categorising Documents

![Participant Document Categories](/images/participant-document-categories.png)

You can add Categories to your Documents by clicking on the Tag icon prior to uploading. This allows you to Categorise your Documents for easy searching.

If the Document Category you want to use is not found in the drop down (hint: you may need to search the first few letters), you can create a new Document Category 'on the fly' by clicking the **Create** button when prompted.

## Editing Documents

Once a Document has been uploaded, or if you are viewing an existing Document, you can edit the Categories and Document name.

To edit the Document name, hover of the Document name and click the edit icon (1).

You can also use the Categories input (2) to edit the Categories for the Document.

## Sending Documents

You can send Documents from within the 'Documents' page within a Participants profile. Previously you would have had to assign a Document to a Record to send — now you can do this from within the Documents page, further streamlining your workflow. To do this select the '**Actions**' button and select '**Send**' from the dropdown menu. You will be prompted to enter an email address to send the Document to — the Participant's email and any Contacts that are linked with the Participant will be available to choose from.

## Document Sending Log

You can now view the history of sent Documents from within the relevant Document. This will help with identifying which Documents have been sent.

## Archiving Documents

Sometimes Documents become outdated or no longer relevant but you don't want to fully delete them. Astalty allows you to archive Documents which will hide them from the main Documents list but they can still be found by adding a filter.

To archive a Document, open the Document and click the **Actions** button - you can then click the **Archive** option to archive the Document.

## Deleting Documents

You can also delete a Document from within the Document view.

## Audit Trail

This allows you to view the upload and change details of the Document.

## Restoring Archived Documents

If you need to restore an Archived Document, it is really similar to the process of Archiving a Document. 

To restore a Document you: 

1. Add a filter to a Participants Document list. 
2. Click the filter button and add a ‘**Status**’ filter and click ‘**Archived**’. 
3. Once you have found your archived Document, click on the Document.

4. Then you will need to navigate to ‘**Actions**’ and click ‘**Restore**’.

![Participant Docs Restore 2](/images/participant-docs-restore-2.png)

Once you have done this, the Document will return to the Documents list under ‘Documents’ on the Participants profile.

## Searching Documents

To search by Document name, you can use the Search input at the top of the Documents table. You can use the search field in combination with a filter (see Available Filters below) for a powerful and detailed search.

## Available Filters

To add a Filter to the Documents table, first click on the Filter icon and then select the filter you'd like to add.

### Status Filter

Sometimes you may need to find an Archived document - you can use the Status filter to do this.

### Categories

If you have lots of Documents, you can use the Categories filter to refine the view (where Categories have previously been applied to Documents).

### File Types

To find a particular type of Document (ie. PDF, Word, Email) you can use the File Types filter.
