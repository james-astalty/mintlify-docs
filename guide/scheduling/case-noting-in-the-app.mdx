- Tap Write Note.
- Enter the details of your case note.
- When finished, tap Create to save.

## Incomplete Case Notes

If a case note is not completed at the end of a shift, it will appear under Incomplete Shifts on the main screen of the Support Worker app. This helps you quickly identify any missing information that still needs to be recorded.

## Completing an Incomplete Case Note

- On the home page, go to Incomplete Shifts.
- Find the shift marked with a red chip showing what is still outstanding.
- If a case note is missing, it will display as Notes: 0.
- Tap the entry, then tap the clipboard icon at the bottom of the screen.
- Enter your case note and save.

Once completed, the shift will disappear from the Incomplete Shifts list.

## Templates

When writing case notes, you may have access to templates if your organisation has set them up. Templates provide a pre-structured format for notes, helping you remember what details to include and ensuring consistency across all case notes.

### Accessing Templates

- When writing a note, tap Templates.
- Select the relevant template.
- The template will pre-populate your case note, which you can then complete with additional details.
