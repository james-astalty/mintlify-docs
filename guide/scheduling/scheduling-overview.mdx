## Overview

Scheduling is the rostering functionality built into Astalty and is supported by an App that support workers can download onto their devices for clocking in and out of their shifts. Not everyone may have access to Scheduling, and this is determined by the access you have been granted by your Admin users. For staff to appear as a Support Worker who can be assigned to a shift, they must be selected as such via their User Permissions by an Admin user.

## Scheduling Side Menu

When selected from the side bar, Scheduling will display the Schedule and the Scheduling side menu. The side menu is split up into 3 sections:

- Plan
- Review
- Process

### Plan

#### **Schedule**

The [**Schedule**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/schedule) allows you to create and view both Direct and Group Supports, including Internal non support shifts and Unpaid Breaks. The Schedule panel can be toggled to display by either Support Worker or Participant and can be adjusted to display by Day, Week, or Fortnight.

#### **Unassigned Shifts**

The [**Unassigned Shifts**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/unassigned-shifts) functionality allows you to quickly identify and allocate shifts that are not yet assigned to a Support Worker. This helps ensure roster gaps are filled promptly, while giving you a clear view of staff availability and potential scheduling impacts.

This menu item will display a badge count for the current amount of unassigned shifts.

#### **Unpublished Shifts**

[**Unpublished Shifts**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/unpublished-shifts) provides you with a list of all your shifts that are currently unpublished within the date range of the Date filter. By default, when you create a support in Astalty, it is created as an unpublished shift. Shifts must be published before they are visible to support workers in the app. To find out more about Published and Unpublished Shifts - [**click here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/scheduling/published-and-unpublished-shifts).

This menu item will display a badge count for the current amount of unpublished shifts.

#### **All Shifts**

[**All Shifts**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/all-shifts) displays a list of all scheduled shifts and supports within the date range of the Date filter.

#### **Activities**

[**Activities**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/activities) displays a list all activities that have been created, including the recurrence of when they occur and the day and date for the next event.

### Review

#### **Availability Request**
