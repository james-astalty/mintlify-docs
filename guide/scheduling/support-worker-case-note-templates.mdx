## Overview

Support Worker Case Note Templates let you standardise how case notes are created and recorded across your organisation. By setting up a template, you can guide Support Workers on what information to include, ensure consistency in reporting, and save time by pre-filling common sections. Templates can be customised with headings, prompts, or instructions, and once published, they appear in the Astalty application for Support Workers to use when writing their case notes.
