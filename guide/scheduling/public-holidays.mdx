## Overview

Astalty automatically applies state-based public holidays to participants based on their location. This ensures that relevant holidays are recognised without additional setup. However, you can also manually add local or special public holidays and assign them to participant groups as needed.

## Accessing the Public Holidays Page

To access the **Public Holidays** page:

- From the left-hand side menu, go to **Settings**.
- Select **Scheduling Settings**.
- Scroll down and look for **Public Holidays**.

Alternatively, you can go directly to the page here: [**<u>Public Holidays Settings</u>**](https://app.astalty.com.au/settings/scheduling)

## Adding Public Holidays

In the event that you would like to add public holidays to certain participants, you may first need to consider that your organisation could be working across multiple locations. For example, you might have participants in **Sydney** as well as participants in **Brisbane**, each with different local holidays. To manage this effectively, you can use **Public Holiday Groups**.

When public holidays are added or removed, Astalty automatically updates any supports scheduled on those dates to ensure the correct charge item rate is applied. For example, if a support was originally scheduled on a standard day, it will be adjusted to use public holiday rates once that date is marked as a public holiday.

## Public Holiday Groups

Public Holiday Groups allow you to assign specific holidays only to the participants who are affected. This ensures that each participant’s schedule reflects the correct public holidays for their region.

### How to Create a Public Holiday Group

- Go to Public Holiday Groups.

- Click Create Public Holiday Group.

![image3-1757913279.png](/images/image3-1757913279.png)

- Give the group a clear name (e.g., Sydney Participants, Brisbane Participants).

Once a group is created, you can assign holidays to it.

### Adding a Public Holiday

If a public holiday is missing from the system, you can add it manually and link it to the relevant group. For example, if you need to add the Sydney Show holiday for participants in Sydney:

- Select Add Public Holiday.

![image5.png](/images/image5.png)

- Enter the following details:
  - Holiday Name (e.g., Sydney Show)
  - Date
  - State
- Assign the holiday to the relevant Public Holiday Group (e.g., Sydney Region).

If the public holiday you’re adding is already in the system, a notification will appear when you attempt to create it. This helps prevent duplicate entries.

### Assigning a Public Holiday Group to a Participant

- Open the participant’s Profile.
- Scroll down and click More.

- Click Create (or Save) to confirm.

This ensures that each participant’s schedule correctly reflects the public holidays relevant to their location.

### **Setting a Default Public Holiday Group**

You can assign or change a default Public Holiday Group that will automatically apply to all new Participants.

- Go to Settings.
- Select Scheduling.

- Scroll down to Public Holidays.
- Click Public Holiday Groups.

![ph-default-2-v2.png](/images/ph-default-2-v2.png)

- Select the ellipsis next to the group you want to set as the default, then choose **Make Default**.

![ph-default-3.png](/images/ph-default-3.png)

The selected group will now be the default Public Holiday Group for all new Participants. You can view this in each Participant's Scheduling Settings.

If you need to make changes, simply remove the default group from their settings and select another group, or add additional Public Holiday Groups as needed.
