## Overview

Follow this workflow to ensure your schedules are published correctly without any issues. This process helps you verify that:

- There are no shift clashes
- All availability requests have been approved
- Any varying availability has been updated
- All shifts have been assigned
- The schedule is ready to publish

## Recommended workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review and action availability requests">
    Review all availability requests for the period you want to publish. Approve or decline any pending requests before proceeding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign all unassigned shifts">
    Go through the schedule and assign support workers to any unassigned shifts for the requested period.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the shift clashes report">
    Review the Shift Clashes Report to identify any scheduling conflicts. Unassign any clashing shifts as necessary.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-assign and verify">
    Re-assign the supports that were unassigned due to clashes. Check the Shift Clashes Report again to ensure no new conflicts were created.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish the schedule">
    Once you have confirmed there are no clashes, publish the schedule. Support workers will receive notifications for their assigned shifts.
