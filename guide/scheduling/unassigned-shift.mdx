## **Overview**

The Unassigned Shifts functionality allows you to quickly identify and allocate shifts that are not yet assigned to a Support Worker. This helps ensure roster gaps are filled promptly, while giving you a clear view of staff availability and potential scheduling impacts.

- Go to [**Scheduling**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/schedule) from the left-hand menu.
- Select [**Unassigned Shifts**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/unassigned-shifts).
- A number next to the menu option indicates how many unassigned shifts currently exist.
