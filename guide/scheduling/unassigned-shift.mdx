### Assigning a Shift

In order to assign a Support Worker, open the Support, scroll to the Support Workers section, and then select the preferred Support Worker by clicking on their name. This opens their schedule in relation to the shift:

- Blue – the shift being assigned.
- Light grey – existing shifts.
- Pink – times the worker is not available.

This view also provides a visual comparison of the Support Worker’s agreed Total Hours and the hours scheduled for the week, as shown in the image below.

If you are satisfied that the Support Worker is able to provide the necessary support, click on the Assign button This view helps you assess potential impacts such as travel, meal breaks, and broken shifts (particularly relevant for Community Access supports).

### Confirming the Assignment

After you have selected Assign you can choose whether to:

- Update only the selected shift.
- Update all shifts in the sequence.
- Update all future repeating shifts.

Selecting Update All Future Shifts rosters the worker on for all future occurrences of that shift.
