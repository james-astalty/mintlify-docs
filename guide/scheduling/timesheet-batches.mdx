## Overview

This page will walk you through how to create Timesheet Batches of all the shifts created in Scheduling. The Timesheets can then be exported via CSV to import into your preferred staff payment software.

  **Timesheet Export Behaviour**

  Staff who have been assigned with the option to exclude them from the Timesheet Export will not be included in the export. To adjust this, navigate to the User's Profile and update their 'Timesheet Export Behaviour' field.

## Accessing Timesheet Batches

[**Timesheet Batches**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/timesheet-batches) can be found in [**Scheduling**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/schedule) within the Process section of the menu.

This page displays any batches created to date, including the date range, number of shifts exported and when it was exported. It also includes the button to generate a new timesheet batch - '[**Create Batch**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/timesheet-batches/create)'.

## SCHADS Interpretation

For more information on what our SCHADS Interpreter can and can't interpret, see our [**SCHADS Interpretations guide**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/scheduling/schads-interpretations-in-astalty).

After selecting the Timesheet Batch to view, navigate to the SCHADS Interpretation menu to view the Interpretations made on the shifts within this batch.

### Viewing the SCHADS Interpretations per Support Worker

This page provides the user with an interpretation for each support worker's shifts that are within the timesheet batch. The shifts within each support worker can be grouped by either a daily view or by an itemised view

#### **By Daily Breakdown**

If you are viewing by **Daily Breakdown** you can view the different pay line totals applied per days, and you then group each of the pay lines across the pay cycle to display the total accumulated amounts of that pay line in the pay cycle.

#### **By Itemised Lines**

If you are viewing by **Itemised Lines **you can view it grouped by the Paylines and Allowances, which will then provide you with the date of support, Pay rate or Allowance, and the amount of units.
