## Overview

The [**Schedule**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/schedule) allows you to view all Direct and Group Supports, including non support shifts and breaks within a chosen time frame. The Schedule panel can be toggled to display by either Support Worker or Participant and their shifts can be edited and new ones created.

## Viewing the Schedule

Whether you're viewing by Participants or Support Workers, their shifts will be displayed horizontally, left to right based on the view you currently have set.

Group shifts by by either Support Worker or Participant.

#### **Support Worker View**

If you are viewing the Support Worker Schedule, you'll be able to see their current hours vs their contracted hours. This will update to reflect whether you are viewing the Schedule by Week or by Fortnight.

- If you are viewing Day or Week, it will display a Weekly total current hours vs Weekly contracted hours.
- However if you are viewing Fortnightly, it will display the total current hours for that fortnight vs a fortnight's worth of contracted hours.

You can also quickly access a Support Workers 'Profile' or 'Schedule' by clicking the 3 dot menu next to their name.

You can easily see how much travel time or distance has been included in the shift by hovering over the dot attached to the line on the edge of the shift. This will help to ensure that supports don't overlap on travel time.

In the rows following each Support Worker, any shifts rostered in this view will show the rostered times and any participants attached. You can add a shift by selecting the blank space within the desired day and row of the Participant or Support Worker. For more on this, view our guide on [**Adding a 1:1 Shift**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/scheduling/adding-a-11-shift)

#### **Participant View**

Any shifts rostered in this view will show the rostered times, and the support worker assigned. If no one is assigned, it will display as 'Unassigned'.

If you hover your cursor over the shift it will display the type of shift (e.g. Support, Group Support, etc), the time with timezone and any details a recurring shift it may be part of.

#### **Search**

Depending on your current view, you can 'Search' by the name of the Support Worker or Participant.

### Adjusting the view

#### **View Date Toggle**

Jump to 'Today' or move forwards or backward depending on the View Mode you have selected (Day, Week, or Fortnight).

#### **View Mode**

You can adjust the Schedule view by Day, Week or Fortnight.

- If you have selected **Day** view, it will display in suitable scale that matches the 'Increments' you have set in the Settings at the top of your page.
- If you have selected **Week** view, it will display Monday to Sunday.
- The **Fortnightly** default view will begin on a Monday of the current week. You can select your fortnight by using the date range to select the day of the fortnight it begins.
- Use the date picker to jump directly to any date outside your current view. For example, if you’re in **Week **View and choose Wednesday from the previous week, the schedule will automatically shift to that week and display the selected Wednesday.

**Adjusting the Fortnight date range**

If you have selected Fortnightly view, you can select when you want your fortnight to start by selecting the day of the fortnight it begins.

### Settings

#### **Time Range**

Tailor your view to display All Day (Midnight to Midnight), or Auto which will display a scale of time where your shifts occur between. This provides you with greater flexibility, whether you have a business that operates 9-5 or is a 24hr a day operation.

#### **Interval (minutes)**

If you have selected **Day** view, it will display in suitable scale that matches the 'Increments' you have set in the Settings at the top of your page.

### Add Shift Button

You can add a shift by either selecting the + Add Shift' button or by selecting the blank space within the desired day and row of the Participant or Support Worker. For more on this, view our guide on [**Adding a 1:1 Shift**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/scheduling/adding-a-11-shift).

### Publish Button

To publish all shifts in the current view, use the 'Publish' button in the top right hand corner. For more on this, view our guide on [**Publishing Shifts**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/scheduling/published-and-unpublished-shifts#publishing-shifts).

### Drag and Drop Shifts

You can easily reschedule a shift for another date/time by clicking and dragging the support to a new time slot. Once the shift has been moved, a pop up will appear confirming the previous and new start/finish times of the shift, and whether you want to **Update all support times linked to this activity** if this shift is part of a recurring schedule (Example: You would select this option when you want to update all recurring shifts to move from Monday at 4pm to Tuesday at 4pm — if you're only updating this one shift, leave this unticked). You can then click **Confirm** to make this change.
