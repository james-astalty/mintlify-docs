### Clocking Out Early

If you need to clock out before the scheduled end time, you may be prompted to provide a note detailing why before you can clock out.

### Participant Sign-off Required

Where a Participant Sign-off is required, you will be prompted with the "Can the Participant sign off on this support" checkbox. If the participant can provide this, select the checkbox to reveal a Participant signature field for the Participant to sign. Once signed you can check out.

If you're unable to get a participant sign off, leave the checkbox unticked and provide the reason in the box provided.
