## Overview

The Break shift type allows you to schedule meal breaks or rest periods directly into a Support Worker’s roster. Breaks can be set as one-off or set to recur on a schedule, helping ensure accurate timekeeping and clear rostering. You can plan breaks in advance for up to 12 months, choose specific days, and set recurrence intervals such as daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly.

## How to Add a Break

Go to [**Scheduling**](https://app.astalty.com.au/settings/scheduling) from the left-hand menu and click Add Shift.

Choose type, Select Break.

### Break Example

### Adding a Break from Within a Support

You can add a meal break directly while viewing a support. To do this:

- Open the support

- Select the three dots next to the Support Worker's name, and click **Add Break**

![meal-break-2.png](/images/meal-break-2.png)

- Choose the break type, duration, whether it is paid, and whether it applies to this shift only or to this and all future shifts, and then click **Create**

- The break will then appear on the support, as shown in the example below.

Meal breaks are based on duration rather than a set time, giving flexibility for the break to be taken at the most suitable point during the shift. This same process applies to both [**1:1 Shifts**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/scheduling/adding-a-11-shift) and [**Group Shifts**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/scheduling/adding-a-group-shift).

### Removing a Meal Break

To remove a meal break, click on the "**X**" next to the break. This will delete it from the support.

Meal breaks will also be automatically deleted when when shifts are unassigned.
