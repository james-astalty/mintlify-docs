## Overview

In Astalty, you can schedule supports to recur on a regular basis using the Repeating Shifts function. This allows you to set up a support that repeats until a specific end date, for up to two years in advance. Supports can be set to repeat daily, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, or at other intervals, and you can choose the exact days on which the support repeats.

Repeating shifts can also be managed when unassigning or reassigning supports, giving you the option to update only the selected shift or all future shifts in the sequence. You can also view a participant’s repeating supports within a specific date range from their profile.

## Setting Up a Repeating Shift

**Create a Support**

When setting up a new support, look for the repeat options

**Set the End Date**

Choose an end date for the repeating support (preset options include 1 Month, 6 Months, 12 Months, 2 Years, or until the Plan End Date\*).

\*If you select a Participant and then choose an end date, the option to select the Participant’s \*\*Plan End Date \*\*will be available to set as the final date for the recurring support. If no Participant is selected, this option will be greyed out and unavailable.

**Choose the Repeat Interval**

- Daily
- Weekly
- Fortnightly
- Monthly
- Custom intervals (e.g., every X days, weeks, or months)

**Select the Days**

Tick the days of the week the support should repeat on (optional)

**Create the Repeating Support**

Once created, the support will automatically be added to the schedule for each occurrence.

<Note>
  **Automatic Day Adjustments**

  If you create a recurring shift and then need to change the start date (for example, from Wednesday to Monday), Astalty will automatically update the recurring schedule to match the new day. However, if the shift recurs on multiple days, Astalty will **not** adjust these automatically. In that case, you will need to manually update each selected day.
</Note>

## Managing Repeating Shifts

**Unassigning or Reassigning**

When unassigning or reassigning a support worker, you can choose to apply the change to:

- Only the selected shift
- All future shifts in the sequence

**Viewing a Participant’s Recurring Supports**

Go to the participant’s profile and set a date range to see all supports (including recurring ones) within that period. The 🔁 icon indicates that this shift repeats.

You can also quickly see whether a support is recurring by checking the mini schedule in the Participant’s Support. A note will appear, as shown in the image below, to indicate the repeat frequency and end date.

## Extending Recurring Shifts

Extending recurring shifts past their current end date is simple — especially if you’re using the [**Recurring Shifts Ending Soon**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/notifications/recurring-shifts-ending-soon-notification) notifications.

- Open the Support
- Click Actions
- Select **Extend Support** or **Extend Group Support**

- Choose the new end date
- Click **Extend** to apply the update

If a charge has been applied part way through an existing recurring support to all future Supports, it will include this newly added charge on all of the added supports created when extended.
