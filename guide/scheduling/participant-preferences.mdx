## Overview

Participant Preferences in Astalty allow you to set specific criteria for matching participants with supports. Preferences can include factors such as minimum age, maximum age, ethnicity, and/or gender. Each preference can be marked as either Nice to Have or Must Have, and you can also add additional background information to the participant’s profile.

These preferences assist during scheduling to ensure participant needs and preferences are met, helping to improve participant satisfaction.

### Setting Up Participant Preferences

- Open the [**Participant**](https://app.astalty.com.au/participants) menu
- Go to the participant’s profile in Astalty.

### Support Worker Compatibility

If a Support Worker is not suitable to work with a Participant, you can easily manage this through the Participant's Preferences.

- Follow the steps above to access Preferences.
- In the Support Worker Compatibilities section, select Add Compatibility.

The Support Worker will now appear in the Support Worker Compatibilities list.

When scheduling a shift for this Participant, any relevant Preferences - including incompatibilities - will be highlighted. If a Support Worker is marked as **Incompatible**, the scheduler can hover over the Incompatible chip to view the reason provided.

If the support worker selected has been identified as having future shifts where they're assigned to support this participant, Astalty will provide a warning and required confirmation prior to being able to create the incompatibility.

If the user confirms this and creates the incompatibility, Astalty will also flag the amount of future shifts this support worker is still assigned to where they're supporting the participant.
