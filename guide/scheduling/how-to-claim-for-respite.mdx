## Overview

Respite services, also referred to as **Short Term Accommodation (STA)**, can be billed in Astalty in two main ways:

1. Adding **manual charges** when scheduling the support.
2. Creating a **direct charge** in the Finance section.

Both methods produce the same outcome, the charges are applied and included in the relevant invoice batch. The option you choose will depend on how your organisation prefers to manage respite billing.

## Method 1: Billing Respite Through Manual Charges

1. **Schedule the Support**
   - Create a support as normal in the **Scheduler**
2. **Add a Manual Charge**
   - Scroll down to **Manual Charges**.
   - Select the **Respite Line Item**.
   - Enter the **Quantity**:

- For a full day (24 hours), enter **1**.

Astalty lets you enter hours as a fraction of 24, and it will automatically calculate the decimal for you. This makes it easy to bill for different portions of the day.

**Examples:**

- **24/24** = 1 full day (24 hours)
- **12/24** = 0.5 (12 hours, half a day)
- **8/24** = 0.33 (8 hours, one-third of a day)
- **6/24** = 0.25 (6 hours, one-quarter of a day)
- **18/24** = 0.75 (18 hours, three-quarters of a day)

Astalty will convert the fraction into the correct decimal value for billing.

- Add the **Claim Type**, a description, and any additional details.

3. **Create the Support**
   - Click **Add Charge**.
   - Finalise the support by clicking **Create**.
4. **Multi-Day Respite**
   - For respite spanning multiple days, you can repeat the same charge setup on each day (e.g., Day 1 and Day 2).

## Method 2: Billing Respite Through Direct Charges

1. **Schedule the Support**
   - Create the respite support in the scheduler as normal, without adding charges.
2. **Add a Direct Charge**
   - Go to the **Finance** section.
   - Select **Direct Charges** → **Create Direct Charge**.
   - Choose the **Respite Line Item**.
   - Enter the **Quantity** (e.g., 1 for 24 hours).
   - Select the **Claim Type**, add details, and save.
