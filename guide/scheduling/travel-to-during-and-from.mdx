The Configure Travel function allows you to record and manage all travel associated with a support.

## Add Travel

To add travel, click Add Travel from within the support.

![image2-1757922189.png](/images/image2-1757922189.png)

You have the option to set the type of travel - to the support, during the support, and from the support. As well as specify the Driver, Distance, estimated Duration, any Details, Charge Behaviour and Pay Behaviour.

### Travel Type

**To Support**

Used to record travel from the starting point (e.g., the worker’s location or first participant’s home) to the support venue. Includes both duration and distance fields.

**During Support**

Used to record travel that occurs while the support is taking place (e.g., between activities or locations). This field only allows you to enter distance in kilometres. It helps when budgeting for kilometres per shift and gives the Support Worker a clear indicator of expected travel during the shift.

Any travel recorded under Travel Type – During Support will be automatically apportioned between all participants assigned to that travel type - this is specific to group supports.

**From Support**

Used to record travel from the support venue to the final destination (e.g. a participant’s home). Includes both duration and distance fields.

For group supports, travel can be configured for complex arrangements. For example, a Support Worker might pick up one Participant on the way to the group, transport all four participants during the group, and then drop home two participants afterwards.

You can also assign different support workers to handle specific participants for pick-up and drop-off, which is especially useful for larger, more complex groups.

See the image below for an example of how this can be organised.

The example below shows the different Travel types being used to create the Travel required for a Group Support, including where there are multiple staff and participants across several trips:

- different pick up points for participants,
- they all travel together during the support,
- one of the staff members is using a pool vehicle (requires hours, but not km reimbursement), and
- the other staff member needs to be reimbursed for both time and kms for using their personal vehicle.

### Driver

This is the person who will be performing the travel. If it's a group support you can create each Travel item with the designated driver attached.

### Distance

When creating travel to and from the support, you can assign the estimated distance (in kilometres) between the start point and the destination.

### Duration

When creating travel to, during, and from the support, you can assign the anticipated travel time (in minutes). Any duration of time incurred by the staff member during travel will count towards the staff member's worked hours.

### Participants in Vehicle

If the support being delivered is a Group Support, you will need to define which participants (if any) will be travelling in the vehicle per Travel item.

### Details

When creating travel to, during, and from the support, you can enter any details about the each of the different specified travel items.

### Charge Behaviour

The Charge Behaviour allows you to customise each entry to ensure that the attached participants are charged correctly for any Travel. This provides you with the flexibility to define the different scenarios of travel that may occur before during and after a support.

For Travel ****To andFrom Support**** :

- None
- Time only
- Kilometres only
- Time & km

For Travel **During Support**:

- None
- Kilometres only

### Pay Behaviour

The Pay Behaviour allows you to customise each entry to ensure that the attached staff are reimbursed correctly for any Travel - this is important if they need to be paid for any kms incurred while using a personal vehicle, or not if they're utilising company/pool vehicles.

For Travel ****To andFrom Support**** :

- None
- Time only
- Kilometres only
- Time & km

For Travel **During Support**:

- None
- Kilometres only

### Delete Travel

Each Travel item can be individually removed by using the Delete option at the end of the row.

## Travel Setup Errors

At times during the setup of Travel within a support, you may receive a validation error that stops you from proceeding due to an error identified with the choices selected. This will display at the base of the Travel items - you will need to resolve or change these selections before the support can be saved.

In the example below, a validation error shows that the Charge Item Set used has no kilometres-during charge item configured - therefore the Charge Behaviour must be set to 'none' (or the charge item set would need to be updated to include this if it was in error) before the support can be saved.

## Company or Accessible Vehicles

In some cases, an organisation may allocate a company or accessible vehicle for supports. When this occurs, the remuneration may differ, you may not wish to pay (reimburse) the support worker for travel, as they are using a company vehicle. However, you are still entitled to charge (the participant/s) for the kilometres travelled in the vehicle.

To adjust travel behaviour for company or accessible vehicles:

- Open the shift in question.
- Locate the settings wheel on the right-hand side of the screen.
- Click the settings wheel and adjust the travel behaviour as required.
