## Overview

By default, when you create a support in Astalty, it is created as an unpublished shift. Shifts must be published before they are visible to support workers in the app.

You can identify the status of a shift by its appearance:

- Unpublished Shift – The support worker’s name appears inside a transparent box.
- Published Shift – The Support is displayed in solid coloured boxes.

## Publishing Shifts

There are several ways you can publish shifts:

**Individually**:

- Open a specific Support, then click on the three dots next to the Support Workers name, and select **Publish Shift**.

**By Day**: Switch to the Daily View, select the date, and publish all shifts scheduled for that day.

**By Week**: Switch to the Weekly View, select the week, and publish all shifts scheduled for that week.

**By Date Range**: Use the date range filter to review unpublished shifts and publish them in bulk.

When you publish shifts from the calendar view, a pop-up will appear showing all shifts that are about to be published. Any unassigned shifts will be listed first so you can review and address them before proceeding.

## Unpublishing Shifts

You may also choose to unpublish a shift in order to make changes. For example:

- Adjusting travel details
- Unassigning and reassigning a support worker
- Editing other shift information

Open the specific Support, click on the three dots next to the Support Workers name, and then select **Unpublish Shift**.

Once changes are complete, you can republish the shift.

For Direct Supports, you can also unpublish the shift from the **Actions** menu.

## Published and Unpublished Notifications

When you publish a support, the assigned support worker will receive a notification in the Support Worker app. The type of notification will depend on how the shift is published — whether you publish an individual shift or publish shifts in bulk from the scheduler using the daily, weekly, or date range view.

If you unpublish a support, the support worker will also receive a notification to let them know the support has been removed from their schedule.

## Key Points

- Shifts are unpublished by default when created.
- Published shifts appear in blue.
- Unpublished shifts are shown with a transparent box.
- You can publish or unpublish shifts individually, by day, by week, or by a selected date range.
