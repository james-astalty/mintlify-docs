## Overview

Astalty gives you flexibility when cancelling a support. You can specify whether the cancellation was initiated by the participant or the provider, set payment preferences, and choose from a range of cancellation reasons. Payment and charging options follow the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Guide, for example, if you charge for the support, you must also pay the Support Worker. In some situations, you may choose no charge but pay, or no charge and no payment.

You can also add further cancellation details for context. These details and reasons are visible to Support Workers in the Astalty app, and they’ll be notified when a cancellation occurs. Once cancelled, the support will display a red banner stating it has been cancelled, and its colour will change to red in the schedule.
