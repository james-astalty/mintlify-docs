## Overview

The Shift Approvals page is where you review and approve shifts before payroll is processed. This includes approving scheduled times, clock-in and clock-out times, and any associated travel claims (including travel, to, from and during support).

<Info>
  **Handy Hint**

  Shifts that have not been clocked in or out will not appear under Shift Alerts and must be followed up on before they can be approved and paid.
</Info>

## Approving Shifts

When reviewing a shift, you can choose to approve based on either:

- Scheduled Times – The rostered hours originally set in the schedule.
- Clocked In/Out Times – The actual times recorded by the support worker.

### Reviewing Travel Claims

You will see separate entries for Travel To Support and Travel From Support.

When approving travel, you can confirm:

- Distance (km) – The number of kilometres travelled.
- Duration (minutes) – The time taken for the travel.

You can approve travel for both:

- Travel To Support – From the worker’s starting point to the support location.
- Travel From Support – From the support location to the worker’s final destination.

The travel options available will depend on how your organisation has arranged travel.

### Rejecting Travel

If no travel is required, you can choose to reject the claim.

### Shift Approvals

While viewing your shifts within the [**Schedule**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/schedule), you can also view and action the approval of shifts.

<Info>
  **Important**

  Only shifts that are published and have also been clocked in and out by the support worker can be approved.
</Info>

Begin by selecting the shift you would like to view.

From within the shift, click the ellipsis (3 dot menu) next to the support worker’s name, then select **“View Approval Details.”**

The [**Shift Approvals**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/shift-approvals) page provides a streamlined overview of all completed shifts that require approval. You can filter the list by review status or date range, making it easy to switch between **Reviewed** and **Unreviewed** shifts for efficient management. All outstanding shifts can be reviewed and approved directly from this page.

### Cancelled Shifts

When approving shifts within Shift Approvals, if the shift was cancelled it will be flagged with red exclamation within the Status. Hovering your cursor over the this will display the reason, and also options to adjust the shift so it can be toggled to:

- Charge / Not Charge.
- Pay / Not Pay
