## Overview

The Activities functionality in Astalty allows you to create and manage activities, set a maximum number of participants, and track capacity in real time. This helps you plan and coordinate group sessions and events while ensuring participant numbers stay within limits. You can also include additional information, such as document uploads related to the group, to keep all relevant details in one place.

## Creating an Activity

### Open the Activities Section

From the Scheduling page, select [**Activities**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/activities) from the left-hand menu and click Create Activity.
