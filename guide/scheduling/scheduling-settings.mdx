## Overview 

The Scheduling Settings page lets you configure key options that affect how scheduling works in your organisation. Here, you can control requirements such as whether a case note must be completed before clocking out, and set how shift approvals are handled, either automatically (including with tolerances) or manually. Over time, additional settings will be added to this section.

To access this page, click the settings wheel on the left-hand menu, select Scheduling. You can access this page [**here**](https://app.astalty.com.au/settings/scheduling). To make adjustments, select the Edit button in the top right corner.
