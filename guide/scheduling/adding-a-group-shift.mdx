## Overview

You can add different types of shifts in Astalty, including

- Direct supports (1:1 Supports),
- Group supports (Supports with multiple Participants),
- Shift (internal/non-support activities),
- Breaks (Meal breaks).

Each shift can be configured with time, Participant, and Support Worker details, along with

travel, charges, and other relevant information.

## How to Add a Group Support

- From the left-hand menu, click [**Schedule**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/schedule).
- On the right-hand side of the screen, click Add Shift.

### Select a Planned Service

- If a planned service has already been set up for this participant, it will appear by default.
- If no planned service exists for scheduled services, you will be prompted to create one.
- For more information on setting up scheduled services, click [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/ndis-plan/services).

### Set the Time and Date of the Scheduled Support

- Use the date and time picker to select the start time and date.
- Choose whether the support repeats (weekly, fortnightly, or monthly) and set an end date.
- Note: Astalty allows rostering up to one year in advance.

### Select the Support Type

Options include **Personal Care, Community Access, In-Home Supports**, **Training** and more.

### Assign Participants and Locations

- Select one or more participants.
- Choose the participant’s address or specify an alternate address.

### Set the Charge Item Set

Choose the Charge Item Set that contains the charge items you’ll be billing from for this group. This determines how the support will be invoiced.

### Select the Group Support Address

Pick the address where the group is _<u>actually located</u>_.

- This will be different from the Participant’s address.
- Use the location of the group venue, not the individual participant’s home address.

### Check Centre Capital Costs (If applicable)

If the group support is delivered in a setting that attracts centre capital costs, tick this option.

- These costs will be billed for the same duration as the group support.
- For example, if a participant spends three hours at a centre-based group, Astalty will automatically bill three hours of centre capital cost under the relevant line item
- from the charge item set.

### Assign Support Workers

Select the worker or workers delivering the support. For larger group supports, you are also able to roster in various ratios, such as 2:5 ratio.

### Meal break

Indicate if there is a paid meal break; if selected, this will appear in the shift details for the support worker(s).

### Selecting Participants

When scheduling a group, you can choose from all participants in your Astalty account. Participants will appear in a list, and you can use the search function to quickly find and add specific individuals to the group.

### Assigning Support Workers to Participants

In larger groups, you can assign specific support workers to be responsible for selected participants. For example, in the image below, Brent is assigned to two participants, while John is also assigned to two participants.

If Support Workers were not assigned to Participants when the Group Support was created, you can assign them later by following these steps:

- Open the support.
- In **Supports Involved**, select a Participant to check whether a Support Worker has been assigned.
- If no Support Worker is assigned, click **Actions for Participant Name**.
