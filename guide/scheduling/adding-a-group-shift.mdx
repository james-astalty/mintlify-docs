## Overview

You can add different types of shifts in Astalty, including:

- Direct supports (1:1 Supports),
- Group supports (Supports with multiple Participants),
- Shift (internal/non-support activities),
- Breaks (Meal breaks).

Each shift can be configured with time, Participant, and Support Worker details, along with travel, charges, and other relevant information.

## How to Add a Group Support

### Navigate to the Schedule

- From the left-hand menu, click [**Schedule**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/schedule).
- On the right-hand side of the screen, click **Add Shift**.

### Select a Planned Service

- If a planned service has already been set up for this participant, it will appear by default.
- If no planned service exists for scheduled services, you will be prompted to create one.
- For more information on setting up scheduled services, click [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/ndis-plan/services).

### Set the Time and Date of the Scheduled Support

- Use the date and time picker to select the start time and date.

### Set the Charge Item Set

Choose the Charge Item Set that contains the charge items you'll bill from for this group.

### Select the Group Support Address

Pick the address where the group is **actually located**.

### Check Centre Capital Costs (If applicable)

If the group support attracts centre capital costs, tick this option.

- These costs bill for the same duration as the support.
- Example: a 3-hour centre-based group bills 3 hours of centre capital costs.

### Assign Support Workers

Select one or more Support Workers delivering the support.  
For larger groups, you can apply ratios (e.g. **2:5**).

### Meal Break

Indicate whether there is a paid meal break.

### Selecting Participants

When scheduling a group, you can select participants from your Astalty account.
