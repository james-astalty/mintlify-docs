title: "SCHADS Interpretations in Astalty"
---

## Overview

Astalty’s SCHADS interpretations are designed for NDIS support workers employed as shift-workers under the SCHADS Award (MA000100). It processes approved shifts through Astalty and translating worked hours into the correct SCHADS pay-rate categories and allowance lines for payroll. It does not replace the need for compliant rostering and HR practices.

## What the interpreter does

- Classifies hours into weekday daytime, afternoon, night, Saturday, Sunday and public holiday categories using the time-of-day and day-of-week definitions in the Award.
- Enforces SCHADS ordinary-hours caps for shift-workers (10 hours per day, 38 hours per week or 76 per fortnight), converting excess hours to overtime and allocating overtime according to the Award’s Mon–Sat first-band and second-band structure, Sunday overtime and public-holiday overtime rules.
- Detects broken shifts, applies broken-shift allowances for days with one or two unpaid breaks and applies double time for work performed beyond a 12-hour span on a broken-shift day, including the special rule that early-morning legs on broken-shift days do not attract night penalties.
- Processes sleepover shifts by paying a sleepover allowance per sleepover and excluding the passive sleepover span from ordinary hours, while still paying normal ordinary/overtime rates for active work performed during the sleepover.
- Automates key allowances relevant to NDIS support work: first aid allowance for qualified first aid officers, kilometre allowances, broken-shift allowances and sleepover allowances.
- Provides detail of which Award rules were applied to each employee’s shifts when they are timesheet batched (e.g. when daily/period caps were reached, when broken-shift or sleepover allowances were applied, which overtime band was used).

## What the interpreter does not currently do

- It does not currently calculate overtime that arises purely because a full-time shift-worker works beyond their rostered ordinary hours but still remains under the daily (10-hour) and weekly (38-hour) caps. In those cases we rely solely on the Award’s daily/period caps rather than roster-based caps.
- It does not automate compliance with roster-design rules (e.g. rostered days off, 10-hour rest between shifts, meal break entitlements, recall to work minimums, remote work/on-call provisions) or day-worker span-of-hours rules.
- It does not create meal allowances for overtime, telephone or heat allowances, or other minor allowances not explicitly listed above.
- It does not manage annual leave entitlements or leave loading, or classification/level decisions

## Conclusion

The interpreter provides a robust and transparent implementation of the core SCHADS monetary rules around ordinary hours, overtime, shiftwork loadings and key allowances. However, several Award provisions remain outside the engine and must be managed via correct rostering or manual controls.

<Info>
  **Day worker rules**

  The interpretation **does not** presently operate or consider day worker rules. All interpretations are based upon shift-workers. See definitions below

  **(a)          Day worker**

  The ordinary hours of work for a day worker will be worked between 6.00 am and 8.00 pm Monday to Sunday.

  **(b)         Shift-worker**

  A shift-worker is an employee who works shifts in accordance with clause 29—Shiftwork.

## Other Common Questions

### Setting Up Pay Items and Multipliers

Whilst we cannot provide payroll advice based on your interpretation and application of the [**Social, Community, Home Care and Disability Services Industry Award 2010**](https://awards.fairwork.gov.au/MA000100.html#viewer-page-heading), these are the Pay Items and their suggested multipliers when setting up your Xero pay items. For the Xero Integration to work correctly, each Pay Item (incl. allowances) listed below in the table will need to be setup within Xero.

You should refer to the the SCHADS Award, or seek professional and qualified advice to ensure accuracy and compliance for your organisation.
