## Overview

Astalty supports two types of services – _Scheduled_ and _Unscheduled_.

- **Scheduled Services** – Used for supports such as _Community Access_, _Group Activities_, _Supported Independent Living_, or any other support linked to a scheduled service using the scheduling functionality in Astalty.
- **Unscheduled Services **– Often used for supports such as _Support Coordination_, _Recovery Coaching_, or _Allied Health services_.

To learn more about Services and why they are important, take a look at [**<u>this page</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/charge-items-services)<u>.</u>

## Services

To manage Services for your Participant, navigate to the NDIS Plan page within their profile.

### Service Status at a Glance

When viewing Services within the Participant's NDIS Plan page, you can quickly identify whether a Service is scheduled or unscheduled by checking the label displayed next to it.

## Creating a Service

Once you have navigated to the Plan you want to add the Service to, click _Add Service._

![Image2 1757914887 Pn](/images/image2-1757914887.png)

You’ll be prompted to create either an **Unscheduled Service** or a **Scheduled Service**.

- If you are providing rostered or scheduled activities, such as _Community Access_, _Group Activities_, or _Supported Independent Living_, select **Scheduled Service**.
- For other supports such as _Support Coordination_, _Recovery Coaching_, or _Allied Health services_, select **Unscheduled Service**.

**Service Name**

The Service Name should clearly describe the service you are delivering. For example:

- Level 2 Support Coordination
- Psychosocial Recovery Coaching
- Occupational Therapy
- Group Activities
- Community Access

**Service Budget Amount**[**<u>​</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/plans/services.html#service-budget-amount)

The total budget amount for this service.

If some funding has already been used, this amount should still be the total amount for the service - typically the total amount listed on their plan. You can then [**<u>reconcile the budget</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/plans/services.html#reconcile-budget-amount).

**Reconcile**[**<u>​</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/plans/services.html#reconcile-budget-amount)

To reconcile a Service budget amount, click the Reconcile button next to the Service Budget Amount field.

**Remaining Amount**[**<u>​</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/plans/services.html#remaining-amount)

How much funding is remaining for this service as of the Reconciled date.

**Reconciled Date**[**<u>​</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/plans/services.html#reconciled-date)

The date that the remaining amount was valid - this will default to today's date.

**Management Type**[**<u>​</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/plans/services.html#management-type)

Define how the funds for this service are managed. This will dictate how charge items are invoiced when you process your [**<u>invoice batches</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/invoicing/invoice-batches.html).

**Service Category**[**<u>​</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/plans/services.html#service-category)

The NDIS Support Category that this Service falls under. This is important as it will dictate which Charge Items can be used for this Service.

If you want to use Charge Items starting with 07, then you will need to select the 07 - Support Coordination service category.

**Service Coordinator**[**<u>​</u>**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/plans/services.html#service-coordinator)

The Team Member who is in charge of coordinating or delivering this Service. This is helpful if you are delivering several services to the same Participant.

Assign the team member responsible for coordinating or delivering this service. For core supports, this may be a Team Leader or Case Manager. For Support Coordination services, this would typically be the Support Coordinator. This ensures there is a clear point of contact for each service, especially if the Participant is receiving multiple services at once.

**Charge Items**\
For Unscheduled Services, you must assign a specific Charge Item to the service. Only one charge item can belong to one unscheduled service at a time.

For Scheduled Supports, you can select both Charge Items and Charge Item Sets. Charge item sets can be configured in the Charge Items section and are based on the time of day to determine the correct charges for the service. You can select multiple charge item sets within a service for a participant.

<Info>
  **Selecting multiple Charge Item Sets within a Service**

  To be able to select multiple charge item sets within a Scheduled service the charge item sets must be within the same Service Category i.e. 04 - Assistance with Social, Economic, and Community Participation.
</Info>

![Charge Item Sets Pn](/images/charge-item-sets.png)

**Calculate Remaining Units Using**

For Unscheduled Services, you will need to select the Charge Item you want Astalty to use to calculate the remaining units. Typically, this would be the standard hourly rate charge item for your service.

For example, if you provide _Level 2 Support Coordination_, you would select the _Level 2 Support Coordination_ charge item to get an accurate reading of how many hours of funding remain.

Due to the variability of charges and supports delivered across multiple days, this feature is not available for scheduled services such as _Community Access_.
