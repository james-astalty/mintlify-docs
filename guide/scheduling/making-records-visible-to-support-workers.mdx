title: "Making Records Visible to Support Workers"
---

## Overview

Astalty allows you to control which participant records are visible to Support Workers in the app. By marking a record type as Visible to Support Workers, you can share relevant information directly on a participant’s profile while keeping other records restricted to office staff. This helps ensure Support Workers have access to the details they need while maintaining confidentiality for sensitive information.

## Turning On “Visible to Support Workers” for Records

In the left-hand menu, go to Settings.

- Select [**Participants**](https://app.astalty.com.au/settings/participants').
- Click Participant Record Types.
- Find the record type you want to update, click the three dots, and select Edit.
