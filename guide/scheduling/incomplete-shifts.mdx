## Overview

The **Incomplete Shifts** section helps support workers keep their records up to date. It appears on the **Home Screen** of the Astalty app under the _Incomplete Shifts_ heading and lists any shifts that require follow-up actions.

## How It Works

- If a shift is missing information, it will appear in this section.
- **Red chips** will display to show what is required:
  - **Clock In Required**
  - **Clock Out Required**
  - **Notes Required**

## Completing Incomplete Shifts

1. Tap on the shift listed under **Incomplete Shifts**.
2. Review the red chip to see what is missing.
3. Add the required information (e.g., clock in/out time, case note).
4. Once the action is completed, the shift will be removed from the Incomplete Shifts list.
