title: "How Do I Charge for Travel in Company Vehicles?"
---

## Overview

In some cases, support workers use a **company vehicle** instead of their own. In these situations, you may still wish to **charge participants for kilometres travelled**, but the support worker should not be reimbursed for those kilometres since it is not their personal vehicle.

Astalty allows you to separate **charge behaviour** (what is billed to the participant) from **pay behaviour** (what is paid to the support worker), giving you flexibility to configure travel correctly.

## Setting Up Travel in Company Vehicles

- **Create the Support**
  - Go to the **Scheduler** and set up the support as normal.
  - Select the participant(s).
- **Open Travel Settings**
  - Scroll down to the **Travel** section.
  - Choose the type of travel (e.g., _Travel During_, _Travel To Support_, or _Travel From Support_).
  - On the right-hand side, open the **Travel Settings** panel.
- **Configure Pay and Charge Behaviours**
  - **Travel During**:
    - Set the system to **charge for kilometres** but **not pay the support worker**.

**Travel To Support** or **From Support**:

- Example: you may wish to **charge for both time and kilometres,** but only **pay the support worker for time**, not kilometres.

- These settings allow you to mix and match pay and charge behaviours depending on your organisation’s policies.
- **Save the Support**
  - Once your travel preferences are configured, scroll down and click **Create Support**.
  - The billing and pay behaviour will be applied automatically for future processing.
