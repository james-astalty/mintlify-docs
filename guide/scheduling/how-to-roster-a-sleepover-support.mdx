## Billing Sleepover Supports

- For **In-home supports**, you may wish to use the relevant **Charge Item Set** so the correct NDIS line items are applied when billing.
- For **Respite** or **SIL supports**, you may choose to use **Direct Charges** instead.

For more information on how to set up and use direct charges, see: [**Direct Charges Guide**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/direct-charges)
