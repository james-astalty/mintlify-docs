---

## Overview

Use Shift when you want something on a worker’s roster without directly billing a Participant. Handy for admin time, meetings, training, office duties, or other internal tasks. It shows on the roster and timesheets, but it does not create Participant charges.

## How to add a Shift

### Open Scheduling

Go to the [**Scheduling**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/schedule) option on the left-hand side menu and click Add Shift in the top right.

### Add details

Enter the Shift details text. Use this for what the task is, where, and any instructions.

### Set time and date

Use the date and time picker to set the start and finish.

### Repeat options

If needed, set it to repeat. You can repeat daily, weekly, fortnightly, or monthly, choose the days, and set an end date. Astalty allows repeating up to 12 months.
