## Overview

This page will walk you through how to add a direct support, including setting the time and date, selecting participants and locations, linking planned services, assigning a support worker, and adding any support or admin details. You’ll also learn how to configure optional travel, apply charges, and understand how shifts are created as unpublished by default.

## How to Add a Direct Support

</Info>

### Select the Support Type

Options include **Personal Care, Community Access, In-Home Supports**, **Training** and more.

### Assign Participants and Locations

- Select one or more participants.
- Choose the participant’s address or specify an alternate address.

### Assign Participant

After selecting the support type, you can add the participant information.

- Select the relevant participant from the list.
- On the right-hand side, the View Details section will appear.

This section helps rostering coordinators quickly find additional information about the participant, such as:

- Tags linked to the participant
- Participant Details (core profile information)
- Information Items (customised details relevant to supports)

By toggling between Participant Details and Information Items, you can gather further context that may be important when rostering the support.

### Select a Charge Item Set

- If a planned service has already been created for a participant, it will appear by default.
- If no planned service exists for scheduled services, you will be prompted to create one.
- For more information on setting up scheduled services, click [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/ndis-plan/services).

### Participant Address

You can assign the participant’s address for the support, or choose an alternate address if there is a different pickup location.

### Assign a Support Worker

- Select the worker delivering the support.
- Indicate if there is a paid meal break. If selected, this will appear in the shift details for the Support Worker.

### Add Support and Admin Details

- Support Details – Visible to support workers.
- Admin Details – Visible only from the desktop application.

### Configure Travel (Optional)

![image1-1757919685.png](/images/image1-1757919685.png)

You can choose to set travel to the support, during the support, or from the support. These fields are optional and can be configured based on your organisation’s preferences. The image above shows an example setup.

The amounts you enter represent the estimated distances and the budgeted kilometres expected to be travelled.

When configuring travel, be sure to specify the driver, distance, and estimated duration. For example, you might budget 20 km during the support. This budgeted amount will be visible in the Support Worker app. See the image below for an example of how displayed to support workers.

### Set Charges

- If billing from a Charge Item Set, configure automatic charges. For example, you would like to bill from the Community Access 04, Charge Item Set.
- For other billing types (e.g., respite, SIL), you may wish to set up manual charges.

Please note that all shifts will be created as unpublished by default. For more information on published and unpublished shifts, please head to the following link [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/published-and-unpublished-shifts).

## Duplicating a Direct Support

Cloning Support allows you to quickly create a duplicate of an existing 1:1 support session, carrying over all details from the original shift. This is useful when scheduling a new session for the same Participant while keeping consistent information — such as the assigned support worker, transport arrangements, support ratios, and location.

- Open the Support you want to duplicate
- Click **Actions**
- Select **Clone Support**
- Update any details that need to be changed (such as date, time, location, etc.)
- Once all updates are complete, click **Create** at the bottom of the pop-out
