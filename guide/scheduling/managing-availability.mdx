title: "Managing Availability"
---

## Overview

The Availability feature enables Support Workers to manage their working availability and submit leave requests directly within the app. Leave can be entered as a one-off request (for single or multiple days) or set up as recurring for regular periods of leave. These requests can be managed either from the User Profile or directly through Scheduling. This functionality helps ensure rosters remain adequately staffed by allowing managers to review leave approvals and monitor any potential scheduling impacts due to staff availability.

## Creating Availability

<Info>
  **Support Workers**

  Users with the Support Worker role can manage and create their own Availability directly within the Astalty App.
</Info>

If you’re an Admin user and need to create availability for another user, navigate to their Support Worker profile within [**Users**](https://app.astalty.com.au/users), then select the Availability menu.

Select 'Create Availability', and complete the required fields.

The available fields will differ depending on whether the availability is set as **Once-Off** or **Recurring**.

- **Once-Off Leave**

  Select whether the request is for a Single Day or Multiple Days.
  - **Single Day**
    - Select the date.
    - Indicate if the leave is All Day, or has a specific start and end time.
  - **Multiple Days**
    - Select the From Date (first day of leave).
    - Select the End Date (last day of leave).
- **Recurring Leave**
  - Select the date range of the recurring leave - if there is no end date, select the availability as ongoing. You can set it for a defined period (for example, three months) or mark it as ongoing if no end date applies. You may wish to use the defined period in the event that you expect your availability will change.
  - Choose how often it repeats, and then define the if the leave is All Day or specific time period.
  - Select the day(s) the leave repeats (e.g., every Wednesday, or every Wednesday and Friday).

- **Provide a reason** for the unavailability.
- When all required details are completed, click **Create Availability** to save.

## Viewing Availability

Once submitted, leave requests will appear within the Availability section of the user’s profile and with Scheduling. The type of availability is indicated by a coloured tag:

- **Red ‘Unavailable’ tag**, indicates the Support Worker is unavailable.
- **Orange ‘Unavailable’ tag with a phone icon**, indicates the Support Worker is _available upon request_.
- **Green 'Available' tag**, indicates the Support Worker has not got any conflicting availability.

### Viewing Availability in the User Profile

Once submitted, all leave requests will appear in the Availability section of the user’s profile. Each entry displays the type, time, date range, and current status of the availability. You can toggle the availability 'Timeframe' filter from the defaulted 'Current' to display 'Past' availability instead.

#### **Current Availability**

All current and future Availability of the User - this includes one-off and recurring entries the end either today or in the future.

### Viewing Availability in Scheduling

Support Worker availability can be viewed via the [**Availability Requests**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/availability-requests) within Scheduling. This allows you to view all requests during a period of time giving you a clear view of all staff availability and potential scheduling impacts. Status filters are shown by default on the Availability Requests page, giving you an at-a-glance view of every stage in the Leave approval process.

The list of Availability Requests will display the user, time, date range, when it was created, and the current status of approval.

## Actioning the Availability Request

Before you decide to approve or deny the request, you can select the pending Availability to view the:

- Reason for the request (alongside the other details of the request),
- Affected shifts - What rosters or participant supports may be impacted by this availability.
- Unavailability Calendar - All current Support Workers and their unavailability in a calendar view

Once you have made your decision, you can choose either to Approve or Decline the request.

Once leave is approved, users will receive a notification in the app as well as an email confirmation. This ensures users are always up to date on the status of leave requests.

## Availability when assigning Staff to a Shift

When assigning support workers to a shift within the [**Schedule**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/schedule) or to a shift within [**Unassigned Shifts**](https://app.astalty.com.au/scheduling/unassigned-shifts), staff availability will be displayed. If a support worker has unavailability that conflicts with or potentially impacts on their ability to do the shift it can be identified by the tag which will display if they are either unavailable (red 'Unavailable') or only available upon request (orange 'Unavailable' with the phone icon). If you hover your cursor over the tag it will display a further context.

You can also use the available Status Type filter to find all Cancelled availability.
