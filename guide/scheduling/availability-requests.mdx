## Overview

Support workers can manage their availability and submit leave requests directly in the app. Leave can be recorded as a once-off (single or multiple days) or as recurring (regularly repeating) leave. This ensures rostering is accurate and helps avoid scheduling conflicts.

## Submitting a Once-Off Leave Request

A once-off leave request can be used when you are unavailable for a single day or for a set of consecutive days.

- Open your Profile within the Support Worker App and select Manage Availability.
- Click Add Request.
