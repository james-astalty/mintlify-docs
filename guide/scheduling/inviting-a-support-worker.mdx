## Overview

In Astalty, you can invite support workers into the platform and decide whether they should be available for scheduling immediately or later. This gives you flexibility in how and when you onboard staff.

## How to Invite a Support Worker

- From the left-hand side menu, go to **Users**.
- Select **Invite a User**.

- Decide if this user should be scheduled for support right away:
  - Tick **This user can be scheduled for supports** if you want them available immediately.
  - Leave this box unticked if you want to add them to the system but not schedule them yet.
- Enter the support worker’s details:
  - Personal information
  - Contact details
  - Bio and any other relevant details

### Other Information

- If you choose not to allow scheduling when first inviting a support worker, you can enable this option later by editing their user profile.
- Unchecking the scheduling box lets you create the user record now and officially invite them into the system at a later date.
