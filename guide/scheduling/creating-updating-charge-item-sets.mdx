## Overview

Creating Charge Item Sets in Astalty is straightforward but if you're unsure what Charge Item Sets are head to our explanation [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/charge-items-services).

Once you do this you will be presented with two options;

1. Preset Charge Item Set - Using a preset that we have created to quickly get started
2. Manual Charge Item Set - Build your own charge item set from scratch

- Community Access
- Group Activities
- Assistance with Self Care

By selecting a preset charge item set you will see the charge item set appear prefilled with the associated charge items as seen below in the example of the Community Access preset charge item set. Astalty has prefilled the relevant Type with the associated 'Community Access' line item including the;

- Support Category
- Charge Rate Pattern
- Name
- Number
- Price (which is customisable)
- Unit
- Gst Code
- Reference
- Notional \$1

Once completed the set will look something similar to this.

#### **Excluding Charge Items from Sets**

When manually adding in the charge items types, some charge items can be excluded by using the provided checkbox to mark as N/A. Once marked as N/A the relevant fields for that charge item type will become unselectable and not be required to create the Charge Item Set.

#### **Copy Charge Item into remaining Charge Items**

If you are completing a charge item set where the charge item doesn't have variable charges for time of day or week, you can use the **Copy to All Day Rates** option to apply it to all remaining day rates.

Simply complete the Name, Number, Price and Unit fields of a day rate and select the **Copy to All Day Rates** option within the **3 dot menu**.

After selecting **Copy to All Day Rates**, the other day rates will be pre-populated with the same detail.

#### **Prefill Reference into Each Charge Item Within a Set**

When the Reference field is completed with a phrase or acronym to describe a charge item set, that reference will automatically populate the Reference field of each individual charge item within the set.
