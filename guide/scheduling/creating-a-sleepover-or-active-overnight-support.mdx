title: "Creating a Sleepover or Active Overnight Support"

## Overview

Active overnight supports are scheduled shifts that cross over midnight. These supports are set up in the scheduler in the same way as any other shift, but with the start and end times spanning two different days.

## Steps to Create an Active Overnight Support

1. **Go to the Scheduler**
   - Open the **Scheduler** from the left-hand menu.
   - Click **Add Shift** to create a new shift.
2. **Set the Time and Date**
   - Enter the **Start Time** (e.g., 10:00 PM).
   - Enter the **End Time** (e.g., 7:00 AM the next day).
   - Ensure that the start and end dates are not the same, as the shift must cross over midnight.
3. **Sleepover vs Active Overnight**
   - If this were a **Sleepover Support**, tick the **Sleepover** box.
   - For an **Active Overnight**, leave this box unticked.
4. **Assign Details**
   - Select a **Support Worker**.
   - Add any **Support Details**.
   - Add **Admin Details** if necessary.
5. **Create the Shift**
   - Click **Create** to finalise the support.

## Viewing an Active Overnight Shift

- In **Weekly View**, the shift will appear across both days (e.g., 10:00 PM – 7:00 AM).
- In **Daily View**, navigate to the start date (e.g., 10th) to see the full shift displayed as an active overnight.
