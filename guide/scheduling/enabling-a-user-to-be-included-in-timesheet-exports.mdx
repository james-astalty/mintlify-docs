title: "Excluding a User from Timesheet Exports"
---

## Overview

In Astalty, you can control which users are eligible to have their shifts exported as timesheets. By default all invited users are pre set to be included in the Timesheet Export. This can be disabled (or re-enabled) in the user’s profile.

## Updating Timesheet Export Behaviour

After selecting the User's profile from the [**Users**](https://app.astalty.com.au/users) page, navigate to the Edit page of their Profile.

Navigate down the Edit Profile page to the 'Other Details Section'. Set the user's Timesheet Export Behaviour to:

- **Include** - if their shifts need to be included in the Timesheet Export (e.g. Support Worker, Team member providing scheduled supports), or
- **Exclude** - if their shifts are to be excluded from the Timesheet Export (e.g. salaried employee who may need to provide scheduled supports).
