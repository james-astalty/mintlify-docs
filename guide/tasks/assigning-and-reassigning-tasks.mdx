## Assigning and Reassigning a Task to another Team Member

We know that the lives of NDIS professionals are very busy and unpredictable. You may take a call for another coordinator or staff member for many reasons. That is why we have created the task assigning and reassign functionality within Astalty. This means that you can record a Task, delegate, and reassign the Task to anyone within your team or organisation, pending if you have the permission to do so.

<Info>
  **Handy Hint**

  This setting can be restricted in the 'users' section of Astalty. You can find more information about this in our [**Updating Roles and Permissions**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/roles-and-permissions) article.

  The delegation or assigning of a Task during it’s creation can be done by all users. Once the Task is created, it can only be reassigned by an Admin or Manager user.

## Assigning Tasks

To assign a Task you must do this from the '**\+ Create Task**' Button. You can find this on any page within Astalty in the position outlined in the picture below.

## Reassigning Tasks

To reassign Tasks you must first create a Task. From here you can click '**Actions**' and then '**Reassign Task**' as seen below.

Upon selecting Reassign Task, you will see the following screen and will be prompted to select a user account to reassign the Task to.

When you have selected the correct user, their name will show in the drop down box. Once you have selected the correct user for reassigning select '**Save**'.

Once saved, you will receive the prompt 'The Task has been reassigned' as seen below.

Now the task will populate on the reassigned users Task Board and they will be assigned to the Task as seen below.

To reassign a Task, **all** of the following conditions must be met;

1. The Task does not have any time assigned to it.
2. The Task does not have any charges attached or all charges have a quantity of 0.
3. The Task is not marked as Complete.
4. You have permission to reassign Tasks.
5. The Task is not associated with a Calendar Event.

Users will also receive an email notification as well as a notification within Astalty ensuring that they will not miss if a Task has been assigned to them.

## Reassigning Tasks to another Participant

To do this, from the task view, simply click the Participant dropdown box and select the Participant you would like to reassign the Task to.
