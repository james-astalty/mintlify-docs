## Overview

Within Astalty tasks you can upload documents. You can do this one of two ways, by either Uploading documents to a Note or Uploading documents to a Task. By uploading a document to a participants task, it also will be uploaded to their participant 'Documents' page. This removes the need to upload anything twice.

## Editing the Name and Adding a Category to an Uploaded Document

When you upload a document to a task you can edit the document name and add a category to a document so that it can be easily sorted within the participants documents menu. To do this click the name of the document, you will then be able to type a custom text to rename the document. To add a 'category' click the 'category' icon to the right of the upload name. Upon doing this you will see a list of categories in a dropdown list. If you cannot see the category you would like, you can just type the category name in the search bar and create the category on the fly.
