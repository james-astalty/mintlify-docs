## What is the Primary Charge?

The Primary Charge represents the Charge Item that makes up _most_ of the work done for a Task. This is often something like Level 2 or Level 3 Support Coordination.

### It must be hourly

The time input on the Task Board and on the right hand side when viewing a Task is <u>always</u> in minutes - therefore, the Primary Charge must always be an hourly Charge Item.

### Charging for kilometres

If you need to charge for something that is not billed by the hour - for example, kilometres, you can do this within the Finance Tab.

## Finance Tab

Once you've opened a Task, you can navigate to the Finance tab. This is where you will see all charges for a Task, including the Primary Charge

### Quantity vs time

The duration input on the Task Board and on the right hand side when viewing a Task is always in minutes however in the Finance Tab, the quantity is entered as a decimal. So 90 minutes would be shown as 1.5.

You will notice that if you update the duration for a Task the quantity for the Primary Charge will automatically update and vice versa.

## Additional Charges

It's common to have to charge for more than 1 thing as part of a Task - you might need to charge for travel time, kilometres or something else.

To add additional charges, navigate to the Finance tab within a Task and click _Add Charge._

You will then be prompted to select the Charge Item you need and adjust the quantity.

## Changing the Claim Type

You can change the claim type for a charge to something other than the default. For example you may need to change the Claim Type to Provider Travel or Non-Face-to-Face-Services.

To do this, simply click on the Claim Type value for any charge in the table in the Finance tab and select from the dropdown options.
