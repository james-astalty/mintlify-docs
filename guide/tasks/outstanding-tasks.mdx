  **Regularly Review your Outstanding Tasks**

## Understanding Outstanding Tasks

Tasks remain outstanding until they are marked as complete. This can be due to various reasons:

- The task is still in progress.
- Additional steps or actions are needed to complete the task.
- Finalisation of case notes, billing details, or document uploads is pending.

## Locating Outstanding Tasks

You can find all of your outstanding tasks on the left-hand menu (within the Task Board) or by clicking [**here**](https://app.astalty.com.au/tasks/outstanding).
