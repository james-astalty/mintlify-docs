## Why can't I assign a Charge Item to a Task?[​](https://docs.astalty.com.au/faq/tasks.html#why-can-t-i-assign-a-charge-item-to-a-task)

There are a few reasons why your Charge Items might not be showing.

1. **You have not yet created any Charge Items.**

   You can create Charge Items in the **<u>Charge Items</u>**section of the guide. If you do not have the Admin role, you will need to reach out to your Account Owner and have them create the Charge Items for you.

   If you have definitely created Charge Items, then it is likely that you have not created a Service for your Participant.
2. **You have not created a Service for the Participant.**

   To assign a Charge Item to a Task for a Participant, you must first create a Service and assign at least one Charge Item to the Service. Please watch the video below showing how to do this.
3. **The Charge Item I need isn't showing**

   Firstly, if the Charge Item is kilometres, please read the section below.

   If some Charge Items are showing but not the one you need, it's likely you haven't assigned that Charge Item to a Service for the Participant. Please watch the video below showing how to set up a new Service, but it also shows how to assign Charge Items to an existing service.
