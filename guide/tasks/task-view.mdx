If you hover your mouse over the Utilisation, this will show you the breakdown of the Participants funding based on the Plan Elapsed Time and funding remaining in hours and also a dollar (\$) amount. You will also see a utilisation variance (Underspending or Overspending) — this is based on Plan Elapsed Time Vs. Funding Spent. This is similar to what you would see within the Participants Utilisation menu on their profile and also the [**Utilisation Report**](https://app.astalty.com.au/reports/participants/utilisation).
