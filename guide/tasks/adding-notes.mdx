## Opening a Task

To open up the Task from the [**Task Board**](https://app.astalty.com.au/tasks/task-board), click on the Task itself - indicated in the screenshot below.

This will then open up the Task and you can start writing Notes.

## First Note

If you have not yet created any Notes for this Task, the Note input will already be open and focussed and you can simply start typing. Once you start typing, autosave will be enabled for that Note.

## Additional Notes

If you need to add additional Notes to a Task, we do not recommend editing a previous Note. Instead, you can simply click the **Add Note** button and this will open up the Note input so you can create additional Notes for the Task.

## Task Summary Export

You can download a PDF Summary of the Task, with the option to include charges. The Summary includes all Notes associated with the Task and is a great option to share with Participants if they request this information.

Additionally, you can now send the Summary via email directly from the Task. To do this, click on **Email Summary** and complete the relevant fields, then click **Send**.
