## Overview

Within the task view, you can navigate to the Goal heading. In this option you can tag a task to a goal or multiple goals. You must first select a participant and also have a Goal entered on the participants profile (click [**here**](https://docs.astalty.com.au/guide/participants/goals) to learn more about this process). The use case for this feature is that when you are completing a Progress report, you can navigate to the Goals menu within a participants profile to reference the tasks tagged with a particular goal.
