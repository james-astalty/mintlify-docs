This video guides users through the process of creating and updating charge items in Astalty. It begins with navigating to the settings page and selecting "charge items." Users are prompted to set up their business region if not already done, followed by importing from the price guide. The tutorial demonstrates how to search for specific items and customise details such as name, claim type, and GST code. It advises consulting with accountants for GST code queries and emphasises the importance of internal references for quick identification. Users are encouraged to add multiple charge items if needed and can easily review and edit details as required.
